🔐 Security Statement

Effective Date: July 19, 2025
Platform: SukuSuku.ai
Operated by: AI Masters World
Backend Infrastructure: Powered by RunPod
Headquarters: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India


---

At SukuSuku.ai, your security and privacy are at the core of our platform. As a cloud-based AI service built on RunPod and leveraging trusted open-source models, we are committed to ensuring that your data, prompts, and content remain protected and handled with care.

This Security Statement outlines the key measures we take to secure our infrastructure, manage user data, and maintain a safe environment.


---

1. Infrastructure Security – Powered by RunPod

Our backend processing and model execution are hosted on RunPod, a secure and scalable GPU cloud platform designed for high-performance AI workloads.

Key protections include:

Isolated GPU environments (containers)

Secure pod orchestration and sandboxing

Encrypted volume storage

Network-level access control and virtual firewalls

Regular maintenance and patching of container images


We do not share pods across users, and each generation session runs in a dedicated, temporary container, which is destroyed after completion.


---

2. Use of Open-Source AI Models

SukuSuku.ai utilizes industry-trusted open-source models for:

Text generation (e.g., LLaMA 2, Mistral, Falcon)

Image/poster creation (e.g., Stable Diffusion)

Music/voice/video generation (e.g., MusicGen, TTS, etc.)


These models run offline or in controlled compute environments, ensuring:

No third-party data collection

No hidden tracking or telemetry

Full transparency over model usage


We do not send your prompts or content to any commercial APIs like OpenAI or Google unless explicitly stated.


---

3. Data Handling & Privacy

We take the following steps to ensure data safety:

Temporary Prompt Retention: Prompts and outputs are stored temporarily for session continuity or performance analysis. No prompts or outputs are shared with other users.

Session Isolation: Each user interaction is processed in an isolated container. Once completed, the environment is discarded.

No Training on User Data: We do not use your prompts or generated content to re-train our models or feed into datasets.


Users may request deletion of their account data by contacting hello@sukusuku.ai.


---

4. Transmission Security

All communication between your device and our platform is protected using HTTPS with SSL encryption. This prevents third parties from intercepting data in transit.


---

5. Account and Access Controls

Strong password enforcement

Role-based access for internal tools

No public access to backend infrastructure

Admin operations are logged and monitored


We encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and keep their credentials private.


---

6. Payments and Billing

All payments are processed via Razorpay, Stripe, or other secure gateways. We do not store your card or banking information on our servers.

These gateways are fully PCI DSS compliant.


---

7. Monitoring & Incident Response

We implement:

Continuous monitoring of backend resources (CPU, GPU, disk)

Logs for suspicious or failed access attempts

Automated alerts for abnormal API usage

Immediate shutdown of misused or abused compute pods


In the event of a breach, we will notify users in a timely manner and follow applicable data protection protocols.


---

8. Open-Source & Transparency

We believe in the power of open-source. Whenever possible, we:

Use open models that are auditable

Avoid black-box proprietary APIs

Maintain transparency around which models power each tool (on tool pages)


This enables users to better understand the strengths, limitations, and risks of generated content.


---

9. Continuous Security Improvement

AI evolves rapidly — and so do threats. We regularly:

Audit our container images and dependencies

Update models and supporting libraries

Harden container configs and limit permissions

Upgrade SSL/TLS settings


Security is not a one-time setup — it's part of our development culture.
